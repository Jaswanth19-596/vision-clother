//  Base URLs of the three Firebase Cloud Functions (backend/README.md,
//  backend/functions/src/index.ts) that front every OpenRouter/Pexels call
//  and the account/payments routes — see Services/ProxyAuthHeaders.swift
//  and each provider service's `endpoint` property. Split by cost/latency
//  profile (docs/backend/architecture.md's "Cloud Functions" section):
//  `proxyApi` (cheap passthrough), `heavyApi` (image generation, long
//  timeout), `accountApi` (payments/account management). Each is its own
//  deployed Cloud Run service with its own URL — there is no longer a
//  single shared base URL.
